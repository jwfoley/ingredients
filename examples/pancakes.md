# Background

I make this recipe frequently. It's based on [this one](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/191885/vegan-pancakes/) but I find the pancakes are too oily if you oil the griddle, and if you just use a nonstick pan it's fine. It's vegan and **it's also very easy**. It's good with all kinds of toppings but trying to mix them into the batter usually ends in sadness. Blah blah blah.
